QUESTIONS 
1. Output Gaps and Policy (6   points).In   this   question,   you   will   explore   the   Keynesian   model   discussed   in   the   lectures.    You   will   be   asked   to   make   some   calculations   and   provide   some   economic   intuition.    Be   sure   to   provide   all   of your   working.   Correct   answers   without   working   may   not   receive   full   marks.
Consider   the   following   equations   representing   decisions   by   households,   firms   and   government:
C(Y) =   125 + 0.5(Y −   T)
I   =   50         G   =   150
T   =   100   Suppose   that   potential   output   is   Y*    =   500.
(a)       (i)    Calculate   the   level   of   output   Y   at   the   Keynesian   Equilibrium   and   then   calculate   the output   gap   (in   percentages).
(ii)    Draw   and explain   a   diagrammatic representation of the   above.    Be sure to   include   key   features,   including   any   intercept   points,   slopes   and   intersections.Now   assume that   unemployment   follows the   simple   model   developed   in   lecture   4, where   people   can   only   be   employed   or   unemployed.   Assume   a job   separation   rate   s   = 0.03   and   a job   finding   rate   f   = 0.47.
(b)       (i)    Calculate   the   steady-state   (natural   rate)   of   unemployment.
(ii)    Assume   Okun’s   Law   (in   percentages)   holds   with   β   =   0.33.      Use   your   answers   from   above to calculate the unemployment rate and hence the rate of cyclical   unemployment.   Does   your   answer   make   sense?   Explain.(c)    Suppose government would like to use fiscal policy to return to the potential level of   output.
(i)    By   how   much   would   it   need   to   change   its   expenditure   代 写ECON10003 Assignment #1 Introductory MacroeconomicsPython

(ii)    By   how   much   would   it   need   to   change   its   taxes   T   (instead   of changing   G)?
2. Estimating Okun’s Law (3   points)In this   question, you will   investigate   Okun’s   Law   empirically   using   an   equation   derived   for you in   the   Appendix.    Understanding   this   derivation   will   assist   you   in   interpreting   your   results,   but you   are   not   expected to   perform. the   derivation yourself.   You will   be   required   to   download   and   prepare the data, make a scatter-plot,   and   then   run   a   simple   linear   regression   (which   you   would   have   encountered   in   your   high   school   Maths   Methods   class   as   well   as   QM1).
(a)    Prepare   the   Data
Use   the   Australian   Bureau   of   Statistics   (ABS)   website   (https://www.abs.gov.au/)   to   download   and   prepare   the   following   data   series.(i) Gross Domestic Product: Chain volume measures (seasonally adjusted) (Series ID:    A2304402X) Note   that   the   data   is   quarterly,    i.e.,    3-month   periods ending in March, June, September, and   December.    Compute   (ln(Yt   ) − ln(Yt−1)) ×   100.
(ii) Unemployment Rate: Persons (seasonally adjusted) (Series ID: A84423050A) Note   that   the   data   is   monthly,   but   we   want   to   make   it   quarterly   to   match   the   GDP series.   Compute   a   quarterly   average,   e.g.,
avg(uDec Qtr) = 3/1 (uOct Mth + uNov Mth + uDec Mth)
Now   compute   the   change   in   the   average   employment   rate   ut    − ut−1   .
Keep   only   calculations   starting   from   the   September   Quarter,   1978,   and   discard   the   rest.   (b)    Make   a   Scatter-plot
Use any program to generate a scatter-plot of the series that you created in part (a), with: 
(i)   quarterly   growth   rate   of   real   GDP   on   the   horizontal   axis;   and
(ii)   change   in   the   average   quarterly   unemployment   rate   on   the   vertical   axis.
Does   this   plot   match   your   expectations?   Explain.
(c)    Estimate   a   simple   Linear   Regression
Estimate   a   simple   linear   regression   on   the   following   equation:
∆ut      = α −   β∆ln(Yt   )   × 100 + εtwhere ∆ln(Yt) ×   100 is the series you generated in part   (a)(i)   and   ∆ut    is   the   series   you   gen-   erated   in   part   (a)(ii).   Report   your   output   and   provide   an   interpretation   of   the   estimated slope   coefficient   βˆ2.
(d)    Bonus   questions for   good   students    (not for points)
(i)   What   is   the   estimated   rate   of   growth   of   potential   output?
(ii)   Do   you   think   that   the   assumptions   of   constant   growth   of   potential   output   and   constant natural   rate   of unemployment   are   reasonable?    Explain.
